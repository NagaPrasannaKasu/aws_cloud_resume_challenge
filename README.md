## About The Project
Here is my journey at cloud resume challenge in AWS. This challenge provided a structured approach to building a full-stack application that serves as both a resume and a demonstration of cloud skills. 

The challenge consists of:

- Frontend Development: Created a static website using HTML and CSS to showcase your resume.
- Cloud Deployment: Hosted the resume on Amazon S3 and implemented HTTPS using Amazon CloudFront.
- Backend Development: Implemented a visitor counter using JavaScript, DynamoDB, AWS Lambda, and API Gateway.
- DevOps Practices: Utilized Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool Terraform and implemented source control with GitHub, and set up CI/CD pipelines.
